Recently [Juzi.bot](https://juzibot.com) was planning to support whatsapp in the web application, so we started working on the project.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<Image img={PuppetWhatsappBanner} />\\n\\n## Primary Goals\\n\\n***Make puppet-whatsapp to be enterprise beta ready***\\n\\nTo achieve this goal, we worked from below aspects:\\n\\n- improve code structure\\n- improve stability\\n- improve functionality\\n\\n## Improve code structure\\n\\nCode structure is also related to the application structure. Before we started, we looked into the code, and found that all the main code logic are written into a huge class called `PuppetWhatsapp`. This is okay for an alpha stage puppet, but the scalability and flexibility will be limited by the structure. To make sure we have an enterprise beta ready puppet, we need to have a better foundation. Based on the experience working on other puppets, we extract below components from the huge class:\\n\\n- [`WhatsappManager`](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/whatsapp/whatsapp-manager.ts): in charge of everything that connects to `whatsapp-web.js`\\n- [\'mixins\'](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/tree/main/src/puppet-mixin): separate implementation of different entities\' into different mixins\\n\\nBesides, we also added a new manager layer to the `PuppetWhatsapp`. With a new `PuppetManager`, we are able to make the `PuppetWhatsapp` class with least logic, and most code are pretty short and easy to read.\\n\\n## Improve stability\\n\\nStability is really important for an enterprise ready puppet.\\n\\n### Login Session\\n\\nThe first step for stability project of a puppet is always keep the login session. Two advantage with an persistent login session:\\n\\n1. easier for develop phase, since restart application won\'t require a new scan login\\n1. easier to maintain stability, when we encounter an unknown state that causes application hangs or crashes, we could confidently restart the application and automatically re-login, recover the application with minor down time\\n\\nSo we spent a lot of time working on the login session. We\'ve also found some issues in `whatsapp-web.js` project. To make sure we could finish `PuppetWhatsapp` within a reasonable time, we decide to fork the `whatsapp-web.js` and fix the problem, \\nthen raise PRs to `whatsapp-web.js` project.\\n\\n### Request Control\\n\\n`whatsapp-web.js` is using the `puppeteer` to control the whatsapp web application, so the api calling rate and amount needs to be considered, if we are making requests too frequent, the `puppeteer` might crash, if we are making too many requests, we might trigger the risk control mechanism of whatsapp. So request control is another key point to ensure stability.\\n\\nTo control the request sent to whatsapp application, there are two different ways, both are important:\\n\\n1. programmatically limit the request rate\\n1. use cache to reduce the get requests to whatsapp\\n\\n#### Request Manager\\n\\nWe created a new class called [`RequestManager`](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/request/request-manager.ts) to handle all request related stuff, and within the `RequestManager`, we added another component called [`RateManager`](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/request/rate-manager.ts). For detailed code changes, please refer to [this PR](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/pull/279)\\n\\n#### Cache Manager\\n\\nWe created a new class called [`CacheManager`](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/data/cache-manager.ts\') to manager different caches. We use [`flash-store`](https://github.com/huan/flash-store) as the underlying data persistent library, which is actually an old friend of puppets. \\n\\nWith `CacheManager`, requests to get same contact or room will be served by cache, from previous experience, this will significant reduce the get requests to IMs.\\n\\n## Improve functionality\\n\\nThe alpha version only supports login and text messages, which is too basic for an enterprise ready puppet. So we started to add more features to the `PuppetWhatsapp`.\\n\\nRefer to new Wechaty 1.0 mixin design, we decide to also use mixins to implement the new functions. We\'ve added 7 mixins\\n\\n- [contact-self](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/puppet-mixin/contact-self.ts)\\n- [contact](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/puppet-mixin/contact.ts)\\n- [conversation](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/puppet-mixin/conversation.ts)\\n- [friendship](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/puppet-mixin/friendship.ts)\\n- [message](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/puppet-mixin/message.ts)\\n- [room](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/puppet-mixin/room.ts)\\n- [tag](https://github.com/wechaty/puppet-whatsapp/blob/9d9db5d308e253d92dae085f32e9b4ffea6fac3f/src/puppet-mixin/tag.ts)\\n\\nSome of the mixin has only un-implemented methods, but they are placeholders for future implementations.\\n\\n## Thanks To\\n\\nWith all works described above, we\'ve glad to announce ***<u>the `PuppetWhatsapp` Beta are launched!</u>***\\n\\n<Image img={Launched} />\\n\\nThanks to developers contributing to the project\\n\\n- [SuperChang](https://github.com/su-chang)\\n- [NickWang](https://github.com/hcfw007)\\n- [Bung](https://github.com/bung87)\\n- [\u8ff0\u4e0d\u4f5c](https://github.com/wedreamer)\\n- [Kelly](https://github.com/guo40020)\\n\\n<Image img={Kickoff} />\\n\\n### New PuppetWhatsapp Maintainers\\n\\nTo award the excellent contribution to `PuppetWhatsapp`, author of Wechaty, [Huan](https://github.com/huan), announced two new `PuppetWhatsapp` maintainers, they are [SuperChang](https://github.com/su-chang) and [NickWang](https://github.com/hcfw007).

Today let\'s talk about why most companies prefer to ask algorithm during interview.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<Image img={algorithmInterviewBanner} />\\n\\n:::info TL;DR\\n1. During the hiring process, companies do not really worried about missing a proper candidate, what they think about the most is the ***<u>Hiring Efficiency</u>***, so the decision made related to hire process is highly related to hiring efficiency.\\n1. Algorithm is a simple and effective way to exam candidate\'s ***<u>problem solving ability</u>*** and ***<u>coding ability</u>***, this is the most effective way to filter out the proper candidates\\n:::\\n\\n## Questions from interviews\\n\\nFrom last year, our tech team has been expanding. I\'ve interviewed a lot of frontend, backend and fullstack engineers. Since our phone interview or onsite interview both asked algorithm questions, some candidates asked me:\\n\\n> ***<u>\\"Does algorithm really helps in the daily work?\\"</u>***\\n\\nThis question was usually raised by someone that does not give a right answer to the algorithm coding problem. However I believe that many developers might wondered about this. My answer is quite simple, ***<u>algorithm helps nothing in the daily work</u>***. During daily work, we usually write code to implement business logic, which is not too complicate. Then the candidates will come up with another question:\\n\\n> ***<u>\\"Why this interview cares about algorithm?\\"</u>***\\n\\nWe can see, the reason that the first question was asked is the second question. \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n### My interview experience\\n\\nIn my all interview experience, the most impressive interview was the one in Google. After I stepped into the interview room, the first word from interviewer was \\"Here is the problem\\". Directly to the algorithm coding problem, Google was the only one company that does not even asked about anything on my resume, even no self introduction.\\n\\nAnd the other two interviews that I\'ve been experienced was Expedia and Amazon, no surprise, both interviews were started with algorithm.\\n\\nBut to be honest, I didn\'t event think about why these companies like to do algorithm during the interview until I\'ve started working in a startup company. What I did was following the information I got from the internet, prepare the algorithm. After I get back to China, I found all the leading internet companies are also doing the same thing, so why?\\n\\n## Why developer interview cares about algorithm?\\n\\nI started to think about this question seriously after I joined the startup company. When the role changed, I am not an interviewee anymore, so I started to think about this question in a different perspective.\\n\\n### The cost of the company during hiring\\n\\nFrom company perspective, it would be great to hire the most proper talent with lowest cost. So what is the cost for company in hiring process?\\n\\n1. Hiring human resource cost: include HR department and the time cost for tech department\\n1. Candidate trial and error cost: when the company hired someone not qualified, this staff has to be fired and restart the hiring process, this case will cost a lot of time, thus a really high cost for the company\\n\\n### The difficulty of the cost problem\\n\\nTo optimize the cost described above, the hiring process has to be carefully designed:\\n\\n1. To save hiring human resource cost, it would be better to have a ***<u>shorter interview time</u>***, so the time of tech department could be saved\\n1. To save the cost of trial and error, the interview should be able to get enough information from the candidate to make sure the candidate is qualified for the position. But for sufficient information, a ***<u>longer interview time</u>*** is required.\\n\\n### Efficiency first hiring strategy\\n\\nTo cover both points listed above, the only way to save hiring cost is to ***<u>improve hiring efficiency</u>***, to find some way that able to gather the most information from the candidate.\\n\\nIf we can understand the the strategy above, it would be easy to understand why some \\"bias\\" exists. For example, some companies have a hard requirement for their candidate: education background, only candidates from public university would be interviewed. This does not mean everyone from community college is not as good as the public university. But from company\'s perspective, candidates with public university education background are more likely to be qualified than candidates from community college. For a higher efficiency, candidates from community college are rejected.\\n\\n### Algorithm, an effective option\\n\\nUnderstanding the efficiency driven hiring strategy, it would be easy to understand why so many companies like to use algorithm to exam their candidates. First of all, algorithm questions is able to verify two abilities from candidate:\\n\\n1. Problem solving ability: break down a specific problem into a programming problem, come up with a detailed algorithm to solve it\\n1. Coding ability: implement a given algorithm with code, make a logic to a program\\n\\nPeople might think the most important ability for a developer is to \\"write\\" code, but actually, the most important ability for a developer is \\"design\\" code. During daily work, the time took for \\"design\\" code are usually reaches 70% to even 80%, the left part are the time to \\"write\\" code.\\n\\nThe two abilities above are the ones that required in developer\'s daily work. Although the algorithm coding problem only asks for an implementation of a given algorithm, and this algorithm might not be used in daily work, but the two abilities are necessary. So with an algorithm coding problem to exam the two abilities is the main purpose of the interview.\\n\\n### I think I am qualified, why reject me only because my algorithm is not good enough?\\n\\nThere might be someone think that, I think I am qualified for the position, I have some advantages other than algorithm, why ignore all those factors, only cares about my algorithm? This reminds me a big news before: Max Howell, the author of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), was rejected by Google. \\n\\n<Image img={maxHowell} />\\n\\nIn this case, Max Howell had significant achievement, but even this case, Google still rejected him. That is to say, candidates with strong background or big achievement failed on algorithm is not a specific case, but a common thing.\\n\\nTo answer this question, we need to get back to the hiring efficiency strategy. Checking all aspects of a candidate requires a lot of time, and there is still a chance that the candidate is not qualified after all checks. So for a higher efficiency, company would rather missed this candidate than spending more unpredictable time. Someone might think this is unfair, but from company perspective, this is the best choice for company interests after carefully comparing advantages and disadvantages.\\n\\n## Maybe it is not that bad to prepare some algorithm\\n\\nSimply talk about algorithm from interview perspective, developers have to prepare it, and this process is boring and suffer. I was also tormented by [KMP algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm) for several day and nights. But algorithm is not only about interviews, it will bring some real improvements to you. I will talk about this in another blog post (still working in progress, will link it after I finished).\\n\\nAt the end, sincerely recommend every developer do some algorithm during spare time."},{"id":"wecom-openapi","metadata":{"permalink":"/wecom-openapi","editUrl":"https://github.com/juzibot/tech-blog/blog/2022-02-18-wecom-openapi.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-18-wecom-openapi.mdx","title":"WeCom x Swagger","description":"During the process integration with WeCom, we found that there are too many WeCom APIs needs to be integrated, and they all require different parameters.

To reduce repeated work and human mistakes, we decide to use some tools generate WeCom API client code automatically.\\n\\nThen we found the `Swagger`, after some trial and error, we got such a convenient tool...\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nGithub: [github.com/juzibot/wecom-openapi](https://github.com/juzibot/wecom-openapi)\\n\\nDemo: [wecom-openapi.juzibot.com](https://wecom-openapi.juzibot.com)\\n\\n## OpenAPI Standard\\n\\nOpen API Standard (OAS) defines a standard, language irrelevant RESTful API standard. It enables developers and machines check and understand features of a specific service without accessing the source code, document or network traffic check. It is easy to read for not only human, but also machines. With a correctly defined OAS, developers could use least amount of work integrating services.\\n\\nBesides, document generation tools could take advantage of OAS to generate API documents, code generation tools could automatically generate client, server code, and even test code. Refer to [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).\\n\\n<Image img={swaggerBanner} />\\n\\n## WeCom-OpenAPI\\n\\nWeCom does not provide documents that aligned with OAS, so we decide to create [WeCom-OpenAPI](https://github.com/juzibot/wecom-openapi).\\n\\n[WeCom-OpenAPI](https://github.com/juzibot/wecom-openapi) is a project take advantage of the integration of `NestJS` and `Swagger`, [@nestjs/swagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs/swagger) provides some decorators to declare Swagger attributes, make it very convenient to manage the relations between APIs.\\n\\n## How to use\\n\\nFirst of all, clone the project to your local environment, install dependencies and start the project. Then the project will automatically generate swagger spec file openapi.yaml inside the root folder. Meanwhile, you can open your browser visit http://localhost:3000/openapi to check Swagger UI.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ git clone git@github.com:juzibot/wecom-openapi.git\\n\\n$ cd wecom-opwenapi && npm install\\n\\n$ npm run start\\n```\\n[WeCom-OpenAPI](https://github.com/juzibot/wecom-openapi) provides WeCom API proxy, so when you are able to debug WeCom API on Swagger UI. Just input your AccessToken as show below.\\n\\n<Image img={authorizeStep} />\\n\\nThen select the local proxy endpoint to avoid cross origin issue.\\n\\n<Image img={proxyStep} />\\n\\n## Code generation\\n\\nThe common code generation tool is [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen), but this project does not generate a developer friendly golang code, so we recommend to use [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) if you want to generate golang code. But this project only support Swagger 2.0, so we need to conver the version of the openapi.yaml file. Here we use [api-spec-converter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/api-spec-converter) to do the version conversion.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm install -g api-spec-converter\\n\\n# convert doc version\\n$ api-spec-converter --from=openapi_3 --to=swagger_2 \\\\\\n  --syntax=yaml \\\\\\n  --order=alpha \\\\\\n  ./openapi.yaml > swagger.yaml\\n \\n# install go-swaager \\n$ brew install go-swagger\\n \\n$ mkdir wecom-api\\n\\n# generate golang code, the target folder must be in GO_PATH\\n$ cd wecom-api && go mod init wecom-api\\n\\n# generate golang code\\n$ swagger generate client -f swagger.yaml -t wecom-api\\n```\\n\\nUtil here, we can see the generated code file inside `wecom-api` folder.\\n\\n```\\n./wecom-api/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 client\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 models\\n```\\n- client folder: Client, Parameter and Response Object\\n- models folder: DTO, Response Entities definition\\n\\n## Example\\n\\n```go\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n  \\"log\\"\\n  \\"wecom-api/client\\"\\n  \\"wecom-api/client/department\\"\\n\\n  \\"github.com/go-openapi/runtime\\"\\n  \\"github.com/go-openapi/strfmt\\"\\n)\\n\\n// define auth object\\ntype auth struct{}\\n\\nvar token = \\"token\\"\\n\\n// implement ClientAuthInfoWriter api\\nfunc (a *auth) AuthenticateRequest(req runtime.ClientRequest, reg strfmt.Registry) error {\\n  // put the token at the right place\\n  return req.SetQueryParam(\\"access_token\\", token)\\n}\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n  departmentID := float64(1)\\n  params := department.NewListDepartmentParams()\\n  params.SetID(&departmentID)\\n\\n  resp, err := client.Default.Department.ListDepartment(params, &auth{})\\n  if err != nil {\\n    log.Fatalf(\\"err: %v\\", err)\\n  }\\n\\n  log.Printf(\\"%v, %s\\", resp.Payload.Errcode, resp.Payload.Errmsg)\\n\\n  for _, v := range resp.Payload.Department {\\n    log.Printf(\\"%v\\", v)\\n  }\\n}\\n```"},{"id":"first-blog","metadata":{"permalink":"/first-blog","editUrl":"https://github.com/juzibot/tech-blog/blog/2022-02-11-first-blog.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-11-first-blog.mdx","title":"Juzi Bot Tech Blog is Live!","description":"We are Juzi Bot Tech Team, we use cutting-edge technologies to build Next Generation, IM based Marketing Cloud.
